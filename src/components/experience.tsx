                and contact information. We also developed a submissions portal using AWS S3 where competition staff could create a new deliverable, to which individual students or teams could make submissions
                such as sign-up forms, and their final reports for the competition. The technologies I was exposed to in this project included a React Frontend, MariaDB database and AWS SAM Serverless API
